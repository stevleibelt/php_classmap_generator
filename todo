bugfix
======
- autloader filename and classmap filename are mixed up
- classmap and autoloader uses paths relative to generator call. If you are using the ability to store the classmap (and|or) the autoloader file into different paths, the paths in the classmap (or|and) in the autoloader have to be adapted relative also.
-> create a general Filesystemclass that provides this kinde of calculation

command
=======

create
------
add progressbar for creation (if possible)
use http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console/helpers/progresshelper.html
->refactor FilepathIterator::iterate()
	- first iterate over whitelisted directories and store filepaths into array/stack
	- count stack to get the number of items for the progressbar
	- provide stack to fileanalyzer and iterate each file with fileanalyzer to update progressbar

filesystem
==========
evaluate if it is usefull to use symfony componten filesystem
-> migrate filesystem

general
======
register autoloader/generated classmap into composer autoloader if possible
write/finish wikipage for better documentation

unittest
========
write unittests
